# 1. Computers
A computer performs calculations and remembers results.

* Declarative knowledge  
  statements of fact
* Imperative knowledge  
  * sequence of steps
  * flow of control to specify step execution order
  * a means of determing when to stop

Basic machine architecture:
* input
* output
* memory
* control unit (program counter)
* arithmetic logic unit or ALU (do primitive operations)

# 2. Programming Languages
A programming language provides a set of primitive
operations.  
Expressions are combinations of primitives.  
Expressions and computations have values and meanings in a programming language.

Aspects of Programming Languages:
* premitive
  for example, numbers, strings and operators
* syntax
  combinations of primitives
* static Semantics
  syntactically valid strings
* semantics
  the unique meaning of syntactically valid strings

Common errors:
* syntactic errors
* static semantic errors
* no semantic errors but unintended behavior

A program is a sequence of definitions and commands.   
Definitions are evaluated and commands are executed by interpreter in a shell.

# 3. Objects
Programs manipulate data objects that have a type to define what programs can do to them.

Objects types:
* scalar  
  cannot be subdivided, for example, int, float and boolean
* non-scalar  
  have internal structures that can be accessed, for example, array and linked list

Objects and operators form expressions.  
An expression has a value which has a type.
