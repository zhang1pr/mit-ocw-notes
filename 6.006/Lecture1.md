# 1. Asymptotic Complexity
If g(x) = Θ(f(x)), they only differ by a constant factor.

log(n) has an implicit base 2 in Computer Science.

log(n<sup>100</sup>) = 100log(n) = Θ(log(n))  
log<sub>5</sub>n = log(n)/log(5) = Θ(log(n))  
log(100n) = log(100) + log(n) = Θ(log(n))  
log(C(n, n/2)) = log(2<sup>n</sup>/n<sup>1/2</sup>) = nlog2 = Θ(n)
