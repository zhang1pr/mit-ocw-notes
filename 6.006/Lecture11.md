# 1. Newton's Method
Finds root of f(x) = 0 through successive approximation with quadratic convergence.

y = f(x<sub>i</sub>) + f'(x<sub>i</sub>)(xâˆ’x<sub>i</sub>), where x<sub>i+1</sub> is intercept on x-axis  
x<sub>i+1</sub> == (x<sub>i</sub> + a/x<sub>i</sub>)/2

To get d-digit precision of a<sup>1/2</sup>, compute floor of (a*10<sup>2d</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>.
