# 1. Dynamic Programming
Subproblems on sequences:
* suffixes - Θ(n)
* prefixes - Θ(n)
* substrings - Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)

# 2. Pseudopolynomial Time
Running time is pseudopolynomial if it is polynomial in the input size and the numbers in input. 

If the input size is doubled, running time will grow polynomially.  
If the word size is doubled, running time will grow exponentially.
