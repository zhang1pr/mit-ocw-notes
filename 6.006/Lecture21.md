# 1. Dynamic Programming
Subproblems on sequences:
* suffixes - Θ(n)
* prefixes - Θ(n)
* substrings - Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)

# 2. Pseudopolynomial Time
Running time is pseudopolynomial if it is polynomial in the problem size and the numbers in input. 

If the problem size is doubled, running time will grow polynomially. If the word size is doubled, running time will grow exponentially.
